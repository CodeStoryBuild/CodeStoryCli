# The Codestory CLI

Git is a powerful tool. It is also an excellent tool for shooting yourself in the foot.

While Git provides the infrastructure for version control, you rarely need to be down in the pipes for daily work. codestory is a high-level interface that sits on top of Git. It does not replace Git; it allows you to use it effectively without the headache.

Think of this as a natural transition to higher-level version control. You get a clean history without the manual labor.
